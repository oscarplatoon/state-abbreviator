State Abbreviator
===================
Let's continue experimenting with `state`, `props`, `inputs`, and transforming arrays.

Release 0
---------
* Scaffold the app using `create-react-app`

Release 1
---------
* Move `statedata` directory in the root of this repo into your `./src` directory (code outside of the `./src` directory isn't compiled, so you'll get errors if you try to import this file from it's default location).

Release 2
---------
* `import` the state data from `statedata/index.js` and use it to construct a UI. The UI must include:
  1. A select input/dropdown menu that contains a list of US states
  2. A component that displays the abbreviation of the selected US state once you select a state from the dropdown.
